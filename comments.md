Time Series Analysis Results
===========================

Time Series Preprocessing
------------------------
Log-Additive Decomposition Process:
1. Log Transformation:
   - Applied to closing prices to stabilize variance
   - Converts multiplicative relationships to additive
   - Helps normalize price distributions

2. Trend Removal:
   - Seasonal decomposition performed on log-transformed data
   - Trend component extracted and removed from all price series
   - Process applied to Open, High, Low, Close prices
   - Volume retained without detrending

3. Non-Trend Component Analysis:
   - Resulting series represents price movements without trend
   - Captures cyclical and seasonal patterns more clearly
   - More suitable for stationarity testing
   - Better reveals underlying market dynamics

Benefits of This Approach:
- Stabilizes variance across different price levels
- Removes long-term trend bias from analysis
- Makes seasonal patterns more apparent
- Improves reliability of stationarity tests
- Allows focus on shorter-term price movements

This preprocessing step is crucial before conducting the stationarity analysis, as it helps isolate the components of interest and makes the statistical tests more reliable.

Stationarity Analysis
--------------------
ADF Test Results:
- ADF Statistic: -5.6379
- p-value: 0.0000
- Critical Values:
    1%: -3.4327
    5%: -2.8626
    10%: -2.5673

Interpretation:
The series is stationary (p-value < 0.05), indicating:
- Constant mean and variance over time
- No systematic trend
- Suitable for direct ACF/PACF analysis without differencing

ACF and PACF Analysis
--------------------
Detailed ACF Pattern Analysis:
1. Short-term correlation (0-50 lags):
   - Strong linear decay from lag 0
   - Suggests strong immediate temporal dependence
   - Correlation gradually diminishes over ~50 days

2. Medium-term pattern (50-150 lags):
   - Transitions into negative correlation
   - Parabolic shape with peak negative correlation around lag 90-100
   - Symmetric pattern suggests cyclical behavior

3. Long-term pattern (150-260 lags):
   - Returns to positive correlation (150-230)
   - Second cycle begins after lag 230
   - Decreasing amplitude in oscillations
   - Clear sinusoidal pattern with period of ~180 days

Key Observations:
1. Complex Cyclical Behavior:
   - Primary cycle length appears to be approximately 180 trading days
   - Suggests potential 6-month seasonal pattern in the data
   - Dampening oscillations indicate decreasing influence over time

2. PACF Analysis:
   - Strong spike at lag 1
   - Few significant spikes afterwards
   - Suggests most correlation structure is captured through the first lag

Trading Implications:
- Presence of both short-term momentum (first 50 days)
- Medium-term reversal pattern (50-150 days)
- Long-term cyclical behavior (~180 days)
- Possible 6-month seasonal effects in the market

Implementation Strategy
----------------------
Step 1: Training and Validation Windows
- Training Window Size: 504 days (~2 years)
- Forecast Horizon: 10 to 42 days (2 weeks to 2 months)
- Step Size: 21 days (~1 month)

Step 2: Rolling Window Structure
Fold Configuration:
- Fold 1:
  * Training: Days 1-504
  * Validation: Days 505-547 (10 to 42 days ahead)
- Fold 2:
  * Training: Days 22-525
  * Validation: Days 526-568
- Fold 3:
  * Training: Days 43-546
  * Validation: Days 547-589
- Subsequent folds follow the same pattern

Step 3: Training and Validation Process
1. For Each Fold:
   - Train Model: Using training window data
   - Generate Forecasts: Next 10 to 42 days
   - Validate Predictions: Compare with actual values
   - Record Performance Metrics: MSE, MAE, trading metrics

2. Window Advancement:
   - Shift Training Window: Forward by 21 days
   - Update Validation Period: Next forecast horizon

Step 4: Performance Evaluation
- Aggregate Results: Combine metrics across folds
- Analyze Predictive Ability: Over forecast horizon
- Identify Performance Trends: Across market conditions

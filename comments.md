Time Series Analysis Results
===========================

Time Series Preprocessing
------------------------
Log-Additive Decomposition Process:
1. Log Transformation:
   - Applied to closing prices to stabilize variance
   - Converts multiplicative relationships to additive
   - Helps normalize price distributions

2. Trend Removal:
   - Seasonal decomposition performed on log-transformed data
   - Trend component extracted and removed from all price series
   - Process applied to Open, High, Low, Close prices
   - Volume retained without detrending

3. Non-Trend Component Analysis:
   - Resulting series represents price movements without trend
   - Captures cyclical and seasonal patterns more clearly
   - More suitable for stationarity testing
   - Better reveals underlying market dynamics

Benefits of This Approach:
- Stabilizes variance across different price levels
- Removes long-term trend bias from analysis
- Makes seasonal patterns more apparent
- Improves reliability of stationarity tests
- Allows focus on shorter-term price movements

This preprocessing step is crucial before conducting the stationarity analysis, as it helps isolate the components of interest and makes the statistical tests more reliable.

Stationarity Analysis
--------------------
ADF Test Results:
- ADF Statistic: -5.6379
- p-value: 0.0000
- Critical Values:
    1%: -3.4327
    5%: -2.8626
    10%: -2.5673

Interpretation:
The series is stationary (p-value < 0.05), indicating:
- Constant mean and variance over time
- No systematic trend
- Suitable for direct ACF/PACF analysis without differencing

ACF and PACF Analysis
--------------------
Detailed ACF Pattern Analysis:
1. Short-term correlation (0-50 lags):
   - Strong linear decay from lag 0
   - Suggests strong immediate temporal dependence
   - Correlation gradually diminishes over ~50 days

2. Medium-term pattern (50-150 lags):
   - Transitions into negative correlation
   - Parabolic shape with peak negative correlation around lag 90-100
   - Symmetric pattern suggests cyclical behavior

3. Long-term pattern (150-260 lags):
   - Returns to positive correlation (150-230)
   - Second cycle begins after lag 230
   - Decreasing amplitude in oscillations
   - Clear sinusoidal pattern with period of ~180 days

Key Observations:
1. Complex Cyclical Behavior:
   - Primary cycle length appears to be approximately 180 trading days
   - Suggests potential 6-month seasonal pattern in the data
   - Dampening oscillations indicate decreasing influence over time

2. PACF Analysis:
   - Strong spike at lag 1
   - Few significant spikes afterwards
   - Suggests most correlation structure is captured through the first lag

Trading Implications:
- Presence of both short-term momentum (first 50 days)
- Medium-term reversal pattern (50-150 days)
- Long-term cyclical behavior (~180 days)
- Possible 6-month seasonal effects in the market

Further Investigation Needed:
- Examine if the 180-day cycle aligns with known market phenomena
- Consider analyzing half-yearly seasonal patterns
- Investigate if this pattern is stable across different time periods

Plan for partitioning the time-series data for model formation
------------------------------------------------------------
Cross-Validation Strategy Overview:

Data Split Structure:
- Training Data: 60% of total data
- Validation Data: 20% of total data
- Buffer Zone: 10% of total data (prevents leakage)
- Test Data: 10% of total data (held out)

Time Windows Configuration:
- Training window size: 252 trading days (1 year)
- Validation window size: 63 trading days (3 months)
- Step size between folds: 21 trading days (1 month)

Cross-Validation Implementation:
- 5-fold expanding window approach
- Each subsequent fold incorporates more training data
- Fixed-size validation periods
- Temporal order preserved (no shuffling)
- Recent folds weighted more heavily in evaluation

Market Regime Considerations:
- Ensure folds capture different market conditions:
  * Bull market periods
  * Bear market periods
  * High volatility regimes
  * Low volatility regimes

Validation Strategy Benefits:
- Maintains temporal dependencies in data
- Prevents future information leakage
- Captures various market conditions
- Provides robust model evaluation framework
- Aligns with observed 180-day cyclical patterns

Integration with Time Series Analysis:
- Strategy accounts for observed short-term momentum (50 days)
- Captures medium-term reversal patterns (50-150 days)
- Encompasses full 180-day cycles in training windows
- Validation periods sufficient to evaluate seasonal effects

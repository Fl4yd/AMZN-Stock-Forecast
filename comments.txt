Time Series Analysis Results
===========================

Stationarity Analysis
--------------------
ADF Test Results:
- ADF Statistic: -5.6379
- p-value: 0.0000
- Critical Values:
    1%: -3.4327
    5%: -2.8626
    10%: -2.5673

Interpretation:
The series is stationary (p-value < 0.05), indicating:
- Constant mean and variance over time
- No systematic trend
- Suitable for direct ACF/PACF analysis without differencing

ACF and PACF Analysis
--------------------
Detailed ACF Pattern Analysis:
1. Short-term correlation (0-50 lags):
   - Strong linear decay from lag 0
   - Suggests strong immediate temporal dependence
   - Correlation gradually diminishes over ~50 days

2. Medium-term pattern (50-150 lags):
   - Transitions into negative correlation
   - Parabolic shape with peak negative correlation around lag 90-100
   - Symmetric pattern suggests cyclical behavior

3. Long-term pattern (150-260 lags):
   - Returns to positive correlation (150-230)
   - Second cycle begins after lag 230
   - Decreasing amplitude in oscillations
   - Clear sinusoidal pattern with period of ~180 days

Key Observations:
1. Complex Cyclical Behavior:
   - Primary cycle length appears to be approximately 180 trading days
   - Suggests potential 6-month seasonal pattern in the data
   - Dampening oscillations indicate decreasing influence over time

2. PACF Analysis:
   - Strong spike at lag 1
   - Few significant spikes afterwards
   - Suggests most correlation structure is captured through the first lag

Trading Implications:
- Presence of both short-term momentum (first 50 days)
- Medium-term reversal pattern (50-150 days)
- Long-term cyclical behavior (~180 days)
- Possible 6-month seasonal effects in the market

Further Investigation Needed:
- Examine if the 180-day cycle aligns with known market phenomena
- Consider analyzing half-yearly seasonal patterns
- Investigate if this pattern is stable across different time periods
